# Runpacker
A naive RunPE "unpacker"

In order to build the p√Æntool, use the default MyPinTool repertory from pin. or try to configure your env to build it.

## Usage

    pin.exe -t MyPinTool.dll -- runpe.exe

Hopefuly, this will create a file named unpacked.exe in the current dir. The project RunPe is a simple implementation for testing (and learning) purposes.
